            <h2>
                Hi everyone, my name is Aviva! 
            </h2>
            <p>
                I have a large background in customer service which assists me in interpersonal communication. Through this work experience, I have also learned that customers sometimes don't know exactly what they are asking for or have various approaches. So it was my job to understand their request, re-confirm it, and bring that customer satisfaction into action. 
                I majored and got my BS degree in Event Meeting and Management. My journey in events came to a stop due to the pandemic. But it was still an adventure to work in a hotel and work weddings.
                My hobbies consist watching movies and being cozy with my cat, and drawing. I mainly specialize in anime-style drawing or scenic traditional medium art.
